# ieRTPI
Project that aims to display complex information on trains in realtime, in Ireland, based on Irish Rail's API
</br>
It currently doesn't do anything :(

ieCurrentDate.py - prints out the today's date, in the format used by the IE API
GetWebsiteAddress.py - prints the URL for a specific train, on todays date
